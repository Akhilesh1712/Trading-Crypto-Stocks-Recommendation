# Trading-Crypto-Stocks-Recommendation
AI Enchanced Project for recommendation of Trading/Crypto/Stocks which we Build for Scale 91 Hackathon.

How to Use it :
 
   1. Firstly you have to Run all the Python Files by running this command in your terminal -> Python {file_name}.py.
      
   2. Then you have to port the index.hmtl file which is the main file of our project.
    
NOTE : IT does not have the stocks Dataset and the Crypto Dataset ,will be uploading in future(due to large size(2.2 TB) we 
       facing problem in uploading).

How AI is working : 

     1.Data Collection: The AI collects vast amounts of data from various sources including historical market data, 
       financial reports, news articles, social media sentiment, and more.

     2.Data Preprocessing: Before analysis, the data undergoes preprocessing which includes cleaning, normalization, and 
       feature engineering to make it suitable for model training.

     3.Feature Selection: Relevant features are selected based on their importance in predicting market trends and stock 
         prices, using techniques like correlation analysis and feature importance.

     4.Model Training: Machine learning algorithms, such as neural networks, decision trees, or ensemble methods, are 
        trained on historical data to learn patterns and relationships between different variables.

     5.Algorithm Selection: The AI employs various algorithms tailored to specific tasks, such as time series forecasting 
        for stock prices, sentiment analysis for social media data, or pattern recognition for technical analysis indicators.

     6.Technical Indicators: It incorporates technical indicators like moving averages, RSI, MACD, and Bollinger Bands to 
          identify trends, momentum, volatility, and potential entry/exit points in the market.

     7.Sentiment Analysis: Utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze sentiment from news articles, 
          social media, and financial reports, gauging market sentiment and investor emotions.

     8.Pattern Recognition: Identifies recurring patterns and chart formations in historical price data, such as head and 
            shoulders, triangles, and flags, to anticipate future price movements.

     9.Market Analysis: Conducts comprehensive market analysis, including fundamental analysis (company financials, 
           earnings, etc.) and technical analysis (chart patterns, indicators), to assess market conditions and identify 
           opportunities.

     10.Prediction: Based on the analyzed data and insights gained, the AI generates predictions for future market 
        movements, including price trends, support/resistance levels, and potential buy/sell signals.

     11.Risk Management: Integrates risk management strategies to optimize investment decisions, including position sizing, 
         stop-loss orders, and portfolio diversification, to minimize losses and maximize returns.

     12.Performance Evaluation: Regularly evaluates the performance of prediction models using backtesting and validation 
         techniques, adjusting strategies based on real-world outcomes and market dynamics.

     13.Continuous Learning: Adapts and improves over time through machine learning techniques, incorporating new data, 
         feedback, and market changes to enhance prediction accuracy and effectiveness.

     14.User Interaction: Provides interactive interfaces for users to input preferences, risk tolerance, and investment 
        goals, tailoring recommendations and strategies to individual needs and preferences.

     15.Real-Time Updates: Offers real-time updates and alerts on market changes, breaking news, and significant events that 
        may impact investment decisions, ensuring timely and informedÂ actions.
